# DREX FormulaChain Testnet App

Forked from the excellent [Boilerplate Dapp by Yannik Sood](https://github.com/YannikSood/eth-nextjs-boilerplate).

This app will provide an interface to interact with the deployed DREX testnet smartcontracts.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Formula-Chain/drex-testnet-frontend.git
